# Task Tracker CLI

A simple Command Line Interface (CLI) application to manage tasks — add, update, delete, and track progress — using a JSON file for persistent storage.

This project is designed to practice:

- Working with the filesystem
- Handling command-line arguments
- Managing structured data (JSON)
- Building a lightweight CLI tool with C#

---

## Features

✅ Add a new task  
✅ Update an existing task's description  
✅ Delete a task  
✅ Mark a task as **in-progress** or **done**  
✅ List all tasks  
✅ List tasks filtered by status (`todo`, `in-progress`, `done`)

Tasks are saved into a local JSON file automatically after every operation.
